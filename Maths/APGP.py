def thoery(a,n):
    '''AP GP
nth term=> a+(n-1)d

sum= avg n => ((First term +last term)/2)n => n(a+ ((n-1)/2)d)

GP=>
r= ratio of 2 consecutive term

first=> a

2nd => a*r

nth a *r**(n-1)

sum => a(1-r**n)/(1-r)

mean and medianÂ¶
mean=> all data sum /number of sum

median=> sort and get middle number or get mean of middle two if even count

prime number
2,3,5,7.....

every prime number can be represented in form 6n +1 or 6n-1 except 2 and 3, where n is a natural number


PnC
Permuatation : arrrangement of R things than can be done out of total N things

np=> fact(n)/fact(n-r)

Combination: selection of R things that can be done out of total N things

nC=> fact(n)/(fact(r)*fact(n-r))

modular arithemtic
remainder obatained after division operation of two operands is known as modulo operation

%

7%2=1

unsigned long long int =>64 bit if growth of output outgrows this , we use modular arithematic to shorted answer'''
